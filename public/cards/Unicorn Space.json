Unicorn Space\n                  is about the passion and purpose that drive you to be the best version of yourself, and what’s on the\n                  line—your identity, fulfillment, and marriage—if you don’t nurture what makes you come alive. It may\n                  seem like a fairy tale to carve out time to get back to playing piano again or research the business\n                  idea that you’ve back-burnered since becoming a parent, but it’s time to reclaim your gifts beyond\n                  your career and family without needing permission or feeling guilt. Note: An exercise class, a\n                  mani/pedi, hitting a sports bar with a buddy, or catching up on your social media feeds are not\n                  Unicorn Space. Your career may be if it’s a Category 5 storm of passion. Be realistic, but think big\n                  as you work to discover or reclaim your essence and talents. Both you and your partner must take this\n                  card!",
